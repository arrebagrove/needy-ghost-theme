##Minimal, responsive and needy theme for your ghost blogging platform - really needy !!

###About:

I have been a wordpress blogger for quite few years now. I have used all kind of themes, theme frameworks and lots of plugins to keep the blog geared. Needy ghost theme is developed keeping a wordpress blogger migrating to Ghost blogging platform in mind.

It keeps your typography on top in the list with more or less similar feeling of using a regular wordpress theme.

Header | Footer | Center | Single right sidebar.

###One thing at a time:

To be honest, I am no designer or HTML ninja or CSS guy or javascript man. I manage to drive through these stuffs in slow pace and not shy or embarrased to admit.

Also, yes - I have worked on this theme while I sit for hours in toilet and poop at times. We all do that and I know you are there right now :P

A programmer promise !!
Someday I would...

*	Optimize the stylesheet and sweep off silly stuffs.
*	Use LESS (or SASS) to maintain the theme styles.
*	Work on responsive UI layout implementation in better way.
*	Work on improvemnts of HTML elements used to get the most out of HTML5.
* 	Explore Handlebar, let's see if we can do something interesting or unique.
*	Modify theme so it would validate HTML5 and CSS validator tests (I found it fails with few errors and warnings).
*	Bring theme color variants, though orange is not a bad color.
*	Create a theme customization and user information fill-up wizard application using .NET (don't know what I might endup making).
