###About:

I have been a wordpress blogger for quite few years now. I have used all kind of themes, theme frameworks and lots of plugins to keep the blog geared.

Needy ghost theme is developed keeping a wordpress blogger migrating to Ghost blogging platform in mind.

It keeps your typography on top in the list with more or less similar feeling of using a regular wordpress theme -> Header | Footer | Center | Single right sidebar.
